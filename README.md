1. **Module/Directory selector** (Select the module directory of your Springboot project)
    - /module directory can contain any number of classes of any names, but they must be the actual entities of JPA or documents of Mongo. 
    - The script supports only one database type per service.
    - The module directory must have the following structure: 
```
module-directory/
│
├─ src/
│  ├─ main/
│  │  ├─ java/
│  │  │  ├─ com/
│  │  │  │  ├─ example/
│  │  │  │  │  ├── module/
│  │  │  │  │  │   └── Entity.java      # Entity class (can have any name)
│  │  │  │  │  ├── Application.java     # Main application class (can have any name)
```
2. **Generate DTOs** (Generate button for DTOs)
    - The first button you would press after the module directory is fully prepared.
    - Generates the /dto directory with /response & /request classes
    - After this script you would have to look at the generated DTO classes and adjust them if you have your specific requirements
3. **Generate Service** (The main script that generates all the service)
    - /mapper - Map between Resquest DTO -> Model & Model -> ResponseDto
    - /repository - JPA/Mongo repository layer for the application
    - /exception - Custom exceptions with Controller Advice for the proper exception handling
    - /service - Service interfaces
    - /service/impl - Service Implementation classes with CRUD operations: create/getById/getAll/update/deleteById
    - /controller - Rest Controller with all the endpoints to interract with service layer. Swagger annotations for all the methods
4. **Generate Tests** (Generate Tests button)
    - Generate tests that cover all the code generated by script
    - It includes all the tests for service and controller layer
